# Getting Started

### In the terminal do:
cd my-app
npm install

### You can then run the project with the command
npm start

### Items to be aware of
Inside the folder named src you will find a file named posts.json. This file will not be used until a challenge later in the content.  

For convenience react comes installed in this template. A package named axios has also been installed as it will be required in a challenge later.

### Using CSS Modules In React App

#### What are CSS Modules?
   - According to the official repo CSS Modules are “CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default”. What does this mean? CSS Modules are not specs or an implementation in the browser, but rather a process in a build step (with the help of Webpack or Browserify) that changes class names and selectors to be scoped (kinda like namespaced).
